# 🛒 QCompare – Product Price Comparison Engine

**QCompare** is an intelligent full-stack price comparison app that scrapes and compares real-time product data from quick-commerce platforms like **Blinkit**, **Zepto**, and **Swiggy Instamart**, helping users make smarter purchase decisions.

Built with `React.js`, `Node.js`, `Express`, and `Puppeteer`, powered by smart matching logic using `Fuse.js`, token-based Jaccard similarity, and custom normalization.

## 🔍 How Matching Works

* Product names are first **normalized** and **tokenized**
* Uses **Jaccard similarity** on token sets across platforms
* Custom logic handles:

  * Brand/variant mismatch (`Amul Butter 500g` vs `Amul Pasteurized Butter`)
  * Quantity variations (`1 L`, `1L`, `1000 ml`)
  * Sold out / Unavailable scenarios
